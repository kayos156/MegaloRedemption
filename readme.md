**This is a modified version of [Jcw87's c2-sans-fight](https://jcw87.github.io/c2-sans-fight/), except with harder attacks. The only changes were the attacks, some text, some sprites, and the "Infinite Loop Detected" function, which means that you shouldn't be testing your own custom attacks here.**

**Go to https://gotoanddie.github.io/c2-sans-fight/ to play the original hard mode!**

**Go to https://kayos156.github.io/MegaloRedemption/ to play my hard mode!**
